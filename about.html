          through relevant, innovative, industry-sensitive
          and environment-conscious
          academic programs and services.
        </p>
        <h1>The Vission</h1>
        <p>
          To be a model institution of learning
          where relevant knowledge is acquired and
          skills are developed in response to the
          needs of the global community.
        </p>
         <h1>Arellano Hymn</h1>
        <p>
Arellano pamantasan namin
Mahal naming Alma Mater.
Alay sa iyo mga puso namin
Lagi ka naming pakamamahalin
Ikaw ang aming tanging bukal
Ng malayang karunungan
O pamantasan naming mahal
Arellano University.

Arellano aming pamantasan
Lingkod na tapat ng bayan
Ang dunong na sa amin ay bigay
Sa buhay ay gagamiting tanglaw
Sa Diyos ang samo nami't hiling
Ngalan mo'y laging magniningning
O pamantasan naming mahal
Arellano University.
        </p>
         <h1>Philosophy</h1>
        <p>
As an institution of learning, Arellano University is guided in all its endeavors by an incessant search for knowledge, a passion for truth and respect for academic freedom. It does not serve any particular creed, dogma or doctrine.
Its primary goal is the development of the youth in a healthy intellectual atmosphere that welcomes discussion and dialogue to the widest latitude governed only by the rights and best interests of the students and the University.
Guided by this philosophical framework, the University pursues the following objectives:

To promote in the faculty and students critical thinking and scientific problem-solving through the use of reason, truth and knowledge.
To provide opportunities for freedom of inquiry and honest research in the field of learning.
To assist in the transformation of the youth into productive, progressive and actively involved citizens of the nation.
To preserve and transmit the cultural heritage of the race and desirable Filipino values.
        </p>
        <h1>Arellano University Logo</h1>
        <p>
          DESIGN
The Arellano University seal was inspired by the heroic photograph of American marines raising the Stars and Stripes on the summit of mount Surabachi.
The seal was prepared by the great artist, Vicente Manansala.
The whole design is expressive of the faith of the Arellano University in the youth of the land as builders of the Filipino nation
MEANING
The three virile young menâ€”representing Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao,
and depicted as raising the Filipino flag on the promontory symbolize the fortitude,
the courage and the sense of social cohesion that the three main ethic groups of the Philippines should possess in the fullest measure,
if we as a people are to realize our dream of a strong and united nation.
